# Radara defence system using-Arduino Uno
| Code is made with Arduino IDE using C++  

## Tools needed
1. You need to have knowladge on Arduino IDE  
2. Basic Trigonometry 
3. Interfacing sensors and LCD with Arduion Uno
## Construction and Working 
 * There are two Servo motors, one is for Ultrasonic Radar and another for Laser.
 * Radar rotate through 130 degree and find obstacle in perticular a range and gives the angle and distance to arduino for further operation.
 * Using trigonometry calculation is made for another Servo motor.
 * Servo motor of laser rotates in same direction and destroy the obstacle by passing lasar on it.
